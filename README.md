Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface

This script can perform three operations:
    . Read and display Tweets from the fake user BrutusShark
      e.g. node liri.js my-tweets

    . Retrieve data about a song from spotify.com
      e.g. node liri.js spotify-this-song Thriller

    . Retrieve data about a movie from omdbapi.com
      e.g. node liri.js movie-this The Negotiator

Note: please capitalize all words in the title when searching
      for a song, e.g. You Are The Sunshine Of My Life

There is a fourth operation, do-what-it-says that is not working
at this time. Control will simply return to the command prompt
if this command is entered.
